Basic fixed size Generic stack implementation 
<br/> Any type can be inserted into the fixed size stack.

<h3>Resizing Array Stack</h3>
<p>
This is a generic LIFO data structure implementation using arrays. This implementation uses array and resizes and shrinks automatically as the elements are pushed and poped . Resizing increases the length of the array twice the initial size. Array traversal happens in an amortized linear time in the worst case.
